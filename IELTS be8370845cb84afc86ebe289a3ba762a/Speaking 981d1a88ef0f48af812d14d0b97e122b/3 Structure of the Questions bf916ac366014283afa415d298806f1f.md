3. **Express Opinions and Ideas:** Be prepared to share your opinions and ideas on abstract topics. Support your views with examples and explanations.

    - Provide an example that is related to the topic or situation being discussed.

    - Offer a potential resolution or course of action to address the problem or challenge at hand.
