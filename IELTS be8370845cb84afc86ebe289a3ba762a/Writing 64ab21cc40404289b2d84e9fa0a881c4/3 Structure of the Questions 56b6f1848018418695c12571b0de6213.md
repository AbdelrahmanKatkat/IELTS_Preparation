        - **Differences and Similarities:** Provide a nuanced analysis by articulating distinctions and commonalities between data points.
        - **Avoid Speculation:** Maintain objectivity by refraining from speculating on reasons for the data, adhering strictly to presented information.
        - **Word Limit:** Adhere to the prescribed limit of **150 words** for a concise and focused report.
        - **Passive Voice Usage:** Foster objectivity by utilizing the passive voice to describe data systematically.
        - **Future Predictions:** When forecasting, employ terms such as "estimate," "predict," and "forecast" for precision.
        
        ## **4. Adding Numbers:**
        
        - **Precision with Approximations:** Introduce nuance with expressions like "a little over" and "just under" for nuanced numerical descriptions.
            
            **1. If small number or fraction or indicate large number put them as words:**
            
            When dealing with small numbers or fractions, it is recommended to express them in words for clarity and readability. This practice ensures that the information is easily understood by the reader.
            
            ***Example:***
            
            - "Approximately **three percent** of respondents preferred option A."

            To introduce slight variations in numbers, utilize expressions such **as "a little over" and "just under." This adds precision** to your descriptions and prevents the repetition of standard numerical phrasing.
            
            ***Example:***

        - **Cohesive Devices:** Enhance coherence by strategically implementing cohesive devices like "however," "conversely," and "likewise."
        - Used Tenses: **Past simple and present simple**
        
        ## **6. Diagrams (Process):**
        
        - **Passive Voice and Present Simple:** Ensure clarity and objectivity through the use of passive voice and present simple tense.
        - **Verb Labeling:** Clearly label all verbs necessary to elucidate the sequential steps depicted in the diagram.
        - **Sequential Linking:** Foster coherence with linking words such as "finally," "first," "then," and "next" to establish a clear sequence.

        ## 8. Cohesive Devices
        
        Cohesive devices are linguistic elements that contribute to the overall coherence and fluidity of a piece of writing. They are essential for creating connections between sentences and paragraphs, ensuring that the text flows logically and the reader can easily follow the author's train of thought. Cohesive devices can be categorized into several types:
        
        1. **Reference Devices:**
            - **Pronouns:** Pronouns such as "he," "she," "it," "they," and "this" are used to refer back to previously mentioned nouns, reducing repetition and maintaining flow. For example, "John completed the project, and **he** received accolades for his efforts."
            - **Demonstratives:** Words like "this," "that," "these," and "those" point to specific nouns, providing clarity. For instance, "The results of the experiment demonstrated that **this** approach is effective."
        2. **Substitution Devices:**
            - **Synonyms:** The use of synonyms helps avoid redundancy, offering variation while maintaining the coherence of the text. For example, "The company implemented cost-cutting measures to enhance efficiency. **These strategies** proved successful."
            - **General Words:** Replacing specific terms with more general ones can contribute to cohesion. "She enjoys various outdoor activities. Hiking, biking, and swimming are **examples** of her interests."
        3. **Conjunctions:**
            - **Coordinating Conjunctions:** Words like "and," "but," "or," and "so" link similar or contrasting ideas. "The research findings were surprising, **but** they provided valuable insights."
            - **Subordinating Conjunctions:** Words such as "although," "because," and "while" introduce dependent clauses, establishing relationships between ideas. For instance, "Although the experiment faced challenges, **it** yielded meaningful results."
        4. **Adverbs and Adverbial Phrases:**
            - **Temporal Adverbs:** Words like "first," "next," "then," and "finally" indicate the sequence of events. "He conducted initial research, **then** proceeded to analyze the data."
            - **Causal Adverbs:** Words like "therefore," "thus," and "consequently" denote cause-and-effect relationships. "The project faced delays; **consequently**, the deadline had to be extended."
        5. **Repetition:**
            - **Lexical Repetition:** Repeating key terms can reinforce ideas and create a sense of unity. "The importance of sustainable practices cannot be overstated. **Sustainability** requires a commitment from individuals and organizations alike."
        6. **Parallel Structures:**
            - Parallelism involves using similar grammatical structures for related ideas. "She enjoys **hiking, biking**, and **swimming** in her free time."
        7. **Ellipsis:**
            - **Omission of Words:** In cases where information is clear from context, some words may be omitted for conciseness. "The team identified the issue and addressed **it** promptly."
        8. **Collocations:**
            - Collocations are combinations of words that often go together. Using them appropriately enhances the natural flow of the text. "The team conducted a thorough **analysis** of the data, revealing important insights."
        
        Cohesive devices play a crucial role in creating well-structured and easily comprehensible writing. By employing these devices effectively, writers can guide readers through their ideas, making the text more engaging and coherent.
