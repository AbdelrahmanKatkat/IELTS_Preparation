            ## Original Answer
            
            The map shows the targeted areas of urbanization in the Norbiton industrial area. In this essay we will discuss the urbanization plan by showing a comparison between the current and the future vision.
            
            Currently, Norbiton industrial area is characterized by Farmland in the North, Town in the West, and a street starting at the center and connecting all the factories in the industrial area. A total of 8 Factories is present in the map. However, this planning is going to be urbanized by the construction of School, Playground, Medical Center, Shops, and a bridge to connect the town and the Farmland. All the houses will be directly built either on the end of the street or on the sides. Both Medical center and Shops will be at the center and both the school, and the playground will be located in the east of the map. The Factories has no place in the urbanization plan.
            
            In conclusion, the urbanization plan can be summarized in replacing all the Factories, build houses, and construct several buildings which will eventually serve the people living the constructed houses.

            ## Test
            
            ## Original Answer
            
            Life can be hard sometimes and not taking risks or seizing the opportunity can make it much harder. However, every risk comes with both benefits and drawbacks. In this essay we will discuss what we lose and what we gain from taking risks in both our professional and personal lives.
            
            First of all, one can divide actions in life into two categories either to explore or to exploit. Exploring means trying new things, while exploit means stick to what you have learned already. However, exploring always comes with risks, but at the same time a possibility of success in both professional and personal life. When one start exploring options, he gets many benefits. First, he starts to be more aware of himself, his actions, his limitations, and the environment around him. With time he may even be united with world. Personally, believe that our personality is like a jewel you need to uncover it, which only comes from the risks of exploring. Sometimes one can fail after taking the risk, but he will with no doubt develop his personality which will eventually let him to great success. The advantage is not only in professional life, as the more you now about yourself the more you select people suitable for your end goals, which means a better life too. I can relate to this exploring journey; in my previous company I was afraid to take the risk which only caused more misery, but when I took it and quit, I became a completely different man who knows himself and the reason to fight for.
            
            On the other hand, the risks can have a lot of disadvantages. First of all, the anxiety will be high most of the time. One will be in a constant state of fear, and who can blame him! The risks mean you are sailing in the sea during a storm. In my view, risks are not for everyone, as some people will not be able to handle the pressure. Second, there is the look you see in the eyes if you failed, especially, if the person giving it to you is a close one. Personally, I believe that if the price can only be categorized in anxiety and some people dislike me that will be a small price to pay.
            
            In my view, taking risks will help us getting out of the comfort zone and develop our personality, but this kind of development means you will pay the price in full.

            A combination between a table and chart is used to demonstrate the cash flow of the police income and spending. The recorded data is based on 2017 and 2018 in Britain. In this essay we will summarize the main findings.
            First of all, the income of the police comes from several sources: National Government, Local Taxes, and other sources (e.g., grants). In general, the budget of the police increased from 2017 to 2018 from all sectors with a total increase from 304.7 to 318.6 million pounds. The National Government contributes the most in the income in both 2017 and 2018 with a budget 175.5 and 177.8 million Pounds respectively. Local Taxes hold the second place in contribution but increased the most from 2017 to 2018. Other sources hold the third place in both years with a small increase in contribution in 2018.
            On the other hand, the police spending is distributed, ordered based on portion value, between three portions: Salaries, Buildings and transport, and Technology. The spending on Buildings and transport is constant through both years. However, there have been an increase in spending in Technology on account of Salaries.
            In conclusion, the income in Police Budget increased from 2017 to 2018 with National Government contribute the most in both years. The spending remained constant in Buildings and transport, but there has been an opposite relation between Salaries and Technology.

            ## Original Answer
            
            In modern era, smartphones are everywhere. It’s common to see them in the hands of adults, as well as the children. This development led us to an important question: why did we reach this point and is it good or bad? In this essay we will discuss this development and show how we can get the most of it.
            
            On one hand, smartphones changed how we communicate nowadays. This development led to great change in patterns of our day-to-day life, and this change included our children too. Most of us ended up spending more time on our phone to check for updates on social media, take courses, calling, etc. This change in habits can have several benefits on our children. For example, one can check up on his children with just one call, which was not the case 100 years ago.  Also, great pioneers in the Technology Field started young and just from their cell phone. Adding to that, the more time you spent on your gives you more time to be UpToDate.
            
            On the other hand, one can spend his time doing something useful and another can waste it.  Children nowadays, have their phone most of the time and without supervision smartphone can corrupt them. The disadvantages can include: less time to study, entering harmful websites, facing big ideas for them to handle like death, bullied, and so on. Personally, I faced the same issue with my friend’s child. The child liked playing games most of the time, which stopped him from interacting with other children, and eventually he became an introverted.
            
            Personally, I believe that this development is needed with the increase in our market requirement. The issue is how to schedule the time on the phone and on how to use it in the right way. Also, I think there should be some kind of regulations based on the location the child is living in.
            
            In conclusion, spending time on smartphones, similar to blade, have both negative and positive, and the burden of guiding our children is on the shoulders of parents and teachers. The time on the phone can lead the child in one of two paths either to achieve a huge success in any field he likes or to waste life on a repeated scrolling action which we can see a lot today.

            The illustrated bar chart demonstrates the change in average weekly spending by percentage. The chart reports two separate years: 1968 and 2018. In this essay we will discuss and report the variation occurred in spending patterns in families in seven different liabilities: Food, Housing, Fuel and power, Clothing and footwear, Household goods, Personal goods, Transport, and Leisure.
            First of all, the families spending pattern varied from year 1968 to 2018 which can be demonstrated in one of three ways: increase, decrease, or constant. Increase pattern, the Housing, Transport, and Leisure increased with different values. Spending on Housing and Transport almost doubled in this period with the highest increase in spending happened in Leisure going from slightly below 10 % to Slightly above 20 %. On the other hand, the money spent on Food, Fuel, Clothing, and Personal goods decreased to be almost half the original value; only Fuel and power didn’t reach this kind of decrease as it decreased from slightly above 5 % to Slightly below 5 %. However, there have been a constant pattern too, but only in Household good which remained constant at slightly below 10 %.
            In conclusion, the variation in average weekly spending can be summarized as: an increase in Housing, Transport, and Leisure, a decrease in Food, Fuel, Clothing, and Personal goods or finally a Stable behavior in spending on Household goods.

            **Overall, your IELTS Task 1 writing is well-written and informative. You have accurately described the main trends in the bar chart.**
            
            Here are a few specific suggestions for improvement:
            
            - In the introduction, you could more explicitly state the main purpose of your essay, which is to describe the changes in average weekly spending by percentage from 1968 to 2018. For example, you could say something like "This essay will describe the changes in average weekly spending by percentage in seven different categories from 1968 to 2018, as shown in the bar chart."
            - In the body paragraphs, you could use more specific language to describe the changes. For example, instead of saying "Increase pattern, the Housing, Transport, and Leisure increased with different values," you could say "Spending on housing, transport, and leisure increased from 1968 to 2018, with the largest increase occurring in leisure spending." You could also use more precise language to describe the magnitudes of the changes. For example, instead of saying "On the other hand, the money spent on Food, Fuel, Clothing, and Personal goods decreased to be almost half the original value," you could say "Spending on food, fuel, clothing, and personal goods decreased by approximately half from 1968 to 2018."
            - In the conclusion, you could summarize the main trends in a more concise way and restate your thesis statement. For example, you could say "In conclusion, spending on housing, transport, and leisure increased from 1968 to 2018, while spending on food, fuel, clothing, and personal goods decreased."
            
            Here is an example of a revised conclusion:
            
            > In conclusion, spending on housing, transport, and leisure increased from 1968 to 2018, while spending on food, fuel, clothing, and personal goods decreased. The largest increase occurred in leisure spending, while the largest decrease occurred in food spending.

            ## Original Answer
            
            Some professions can hold a greater value for the country, as an example doctors and engineers, which resulted in a common concern on wither to set a limitation on these kinds of professions to only work where they got their training or give them the freedom to work anywhere. In this essay we will discuss both points of view and show some possible solutions.
            
            On one hand, one can see that the current trend in the world is technology, and this trend is going on for years now. The country that can win the technological war can dominate the economical state of other countries. Furthermore, the pillar of the technology is based on some professions like doctors and engineers. As a result, if we didn’t set some kind of a limitation or a rule on them after their training to only work on the country they trained in, they will transfer all their knowledge to other countries. So, one can consider it as a payback for the time and money the country spent on them.
            
            On the other hand, a limitation is not a good solution to any problem. To clarify, some people may study abroad to help their own country and by setting this kind of limitation will be like putting them in prison. Also, the assumption that some professions hold a higher value than other professions is not a proven assumption and can have some serious drawback, for example it may stop people from entering the higher value professions as it will limit their freedom. Personally, I believe that we should set some rules after the training to limit the movement of all professions but only for a determined period of time and we can also make them sign an NDA to avoid information leakage. In my view this approach is a middle ground and I already experienced it in different companies, and I think it can be generalized on the whole country
            
            As far as I am concerned, the limitation on any profession can solve some economical issues but can as a result it can cause some serious disadvantages if not delt with in the correct way. A good approach is to set a rule to limit their movement and after that they can work anywhere without any limitation.

            **Overall, your IELTS Task 1 writing is well-written and informative. You have accurately summarized the main findings from the table and chart.**
            
            Here are a few specific suggestions for improvement:
            
            - In the introduction, you could more explicitly state the main purpose of your essay, which is to summarize the main findings from the table and chart. For example, you could say something like "This essay will summarize the main findings from the table and chart on police income and spending in Britain in 2017 and 2018."
            - In the body paragraphs, you could use more specific language to describe the changes. For example, instead of saying "The spending on Buildings and transport is constant through both years," you could say "The spending on buildings and transport remained unchanged from 2017 to 2018." You could also use more precise language to describe the relationship between salaries and technology. For example, instead of saying "there has been an opposite relation between Salaries and Technology," you could say "the spending on technology increased at the expense of the spending on salaries."
            - In the conclusion, you could summarize the main findings in a more concise way and restate your thesis statement. For example, you could say "In conclusion, the police budget increased from 2017 to 2018, with the national government contributing the most. The spending on buildings and transport remained unchanged, while the spending on technology increased at the expense of the spending on salaries."
            
            Here is an example of a revised conclusion:
            
            > In conclusion, the police budget increased from 2017 to 2018, with the national government contributing the most. The spending on buildings and transport remained unchanged, while the spending on technology increased at the expense of the spending on salaries.
