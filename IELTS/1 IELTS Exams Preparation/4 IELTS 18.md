            ### My answer:
            
            The graph represents the documented number of people living in four Asian countries from the year 1970 till the year 2020. The forecasted population is presented in the graph between 2030-and 2040.
            
            In 1970, the population of Indonesia came forth between the four countries with a population just below 15 % compared to percentage of population in Philippines which is almost double the percentage of Indonesian people.
            Between 1970 to 2020, a transition phase occurred which ended up with Population of Malaysia to score slightly above a double of it is original value of 30% of total population. This increase put it first above Philippines which is forecasted to continue until the year 2040. Itâ€™s also worth mentioning, there was corner stone for the people in 2000 where their population started dramatically increase to exceed the population in both Philippines and Malaysia.
            
            Overall, this graph represents both the predicted values and previous values of four different countries. The change through the year is recorded in percentage which for all the countries showed a trend of increase from the year 1970 till 2040 for most of the time.

            **Specific suggestions:**
            
            - Avoid using vague or informal language, such as "came forth" and "corner stone." Instead, use more precise and formal language, such as "had the lowest" and "began to grow rapidly."
            - Be more specific when describing the data. For example, instead of saying "the population of Malaysia more than doubled," say "increased from 30% to over 70%."
            - Use more varied sentence structures. For example, instead of writing "The change through the year is recorded in percentage which for all the countries showed a trend of increase from the year 1970 till 2040 for most of the time," you could write "The line graph shows that the urban population has increased in all four countries over the past five decades, with this trend projected to continue in the coming years."
            - Proofread your answer carefully to catch any errors in grammar or spelling.
            
            Overall, your answer is well-organized and informative. With a few minor revisions, it could be even stronger.

            ![Untitled](IELTS%2018/Untitled%203.png)
            
            ## Original Answer
            
            One of the most important aspects to consider during advancement of science is to how to harness it for the good of mankind. In this essay we will discuss how the science can improve people life and why should we put this goal in front of our eyes. We will also consider an example to show how a different goal can lead to disastrous outcome.
            
            In the recent years, any improvement in science materializes in our day-to-day life. One can see the improvement in various disciplinary of science. Taking Agriculture for example, the recent development of new watering techniques like using aircraft or drones paved the way for us to harvest more crops and more time for farmers, which in return helped the economy grow. Similarly, in Mechanical Engineering we have witnessed a break-through in production due to the new AI technologies which helped improve not only the productivity, but also the quality of the product. On the same scale, we can see how Medical Improvement helped us overcome the pandemic of Corona Virus. All of these examples wouldnâ€™t have been possible without considering the human as our main priority. Personally, I believe that science without considering the human is similar to a human without a heart. I would like to mention that recently, I had the privilege to try a new Chatbot called ChatGPT. The company that made it is called OpenAI, and they are mainly non-profit organization. Their goal was to make AI available for everyone, and this mindset was mainly based on the improvement of peopleâ€™s life. This mindset improved not only my life but the life of most of colleges.
            
            On the other hand, if we considered different goal like aiming for money instead of peopleâ€™s lives, one can see the consequences in different aspects of life. To clarify, one can consider Military improvement as a necessity but what if the goal for improvement is to gain more money! This can lead to wars, which can only be beneficial to the victorious country and not in all scenarios too.
            
            In conclusion, when scientists put their goal to improve our life, one can see a tremendous improvement in our living from different angels starting from the food to the bed we sleep in. The advancement in life will in return help improve the economy.

            **Overall, your essay is well-written and informative. You have a clear thesis statement and you support it with relevant examples and evidence. However, there are a few areas where you could improve:**
            
            - **Introduction:** Your introduction is a bit long and could be more concise.

            - **Conclusion:** Your conclusion is a bit weak and could be more forceful. You could restate your thesis statement and summarize your main points. You could also end with a strong statement about the importance of using science for the good of mankind.
            
            **Specific suggestions:**
            
            - **Introduction:**
                - Restate your thesis statement more directly, such as: "Science can be harnessed for the good of mankind by improving people's lives in many ways."

            The bar chart below illustrates a relation between two variables. On the x-axis one can see three clusters of Years: 2007,2011, and 2015 and on the y-axis the Number of Households in millions. In this essay we will describe the change in patterns during these years.
            
             the year 2007 to the year 2015 the pattern in which the number of houses making more than a hundred thousand dollars was decreasing in 2011 and increasing again in 2015. On contrast, both houses making less than $25.000 and between $ 25.000 and $ 49.999 had the opposite pattern.
            
            During the same period, count of houses making $ 50.000-$ 75.999 was stable: slightly above 20 million people. A similar pattern is presented in houses making $75.000-$ 99.999 at a constant number of 15 million with a small fluctuation.
            
            In conclusion, one can see three patterns in the data. The first one is more oriented to be stable, and the other two has an opposite behavior to each other.

            **Overall, your IELTS Task 1 academic writing is well-organized and informative. You have accurately described the main features of the bar chart and made comparisons where relevant.** However, there are a few areas where you could improve:
            
            - **Introduction:** Your introduction is a bit long and could be more concise. You could start by stating the main purpose of the chart and the overall trend, such as: "The bar chart shows the number of households in the US by annual income in 2007, 2011, and 2015. Overall, the number of households making more than $100,000 decreased in 2011 and then increased again in 2015."
            - **Body paragraphs:** Your body paragraphs are well-written and informative. However, you could make them even stronger by using more specific language and evidence. For example, instead of saying "Between the year 2007 to the year 2015 the pattern in which the number of houses making more than a hundred thousand dollars was decreasing in 2011 and increasing again in 2015," you could say "The number of households making more than $100,000 decreased from 30 million in 2007 to 27 million in 2011, but then increased back to 33 million in 2015." You could also provide more details about the other income categories. For example, you could mention that the number of households making less than $25,000 and between $25,000 and $49,999 remained relatively stable during this period, while the number of households making $50,000-$74,999 and $75,000-$99,999 increased slightly.
            - **Conclusion:** Your conclusion is a bit weak and could be more forceful. You could restate the main trends and patterns in the data, and you could also make a generalization about the implications of the data. For example, you could say: "In conclusion, the bar chart shows that the number of households making more than $100,000 decreased in 2011 but then increased again in 2015. The number of households making less than $25,000 and between $25,000 and $49,999 remained relatively stable during this period, while the number of househol ds making $50,000-$74,999 and $75,000-$99,999 increased slightly.

            During university, people tend to take one of two paths. Some students decide to only study to get a higher score and perfect there Major, and others decide to widen their horizon by entering new fields. In this essay we will discuss both points of view in details.
            
            Nowadays, life is changing so fast that you need to keep yourself updated all the time. The continuous growth mindset starts at collage. Students who try different fields and get them involved in topics outside their studies like student activities tend to have this mindset. This prospective toward life help man to grow not only in his field but also in real world. For example, in industry there is no project where you will be working alone which needs communication, and sometimes you will be working on something that is outside of your original studies. This need for diversity in the industry can be met during collage in both technical and non-technical student activities. Both activities can help students to widen their horizon in their field and outside of it.
            
            On the other hand, some students decide to focus on their courses only. One can say that they are more oriented to master their craft. So, I tend to call people with mindset the single-minded people. This mindset will give the one holding it a higher chance of scoring better in their exams and consequently be on top of their class. For example, in Academia people who gets higher grade in Bachelor tend to get into a better collage during their Master which will eventually help them land a better job and increase their income.
            
            Personally, I believe both mindset is needed in any team. I worked for several companies till this point in my life and in all of them I have seen both mindsets. The continuous growth mindset tends to be better in tough situation or any situation that needs creativity, which I think stems from their widened horizon. The single-minded people tend to produce a better and organized result if they were put in a stable system and can also focus on Academia better which is needed in any research project.
            
            In conclusion, both prospective can be really helpful depending on the scenario that they will be put in. One can be more creative and can communicate better and the other can be more organized and focused on a single goal.

            **Your essay is well-written and informative, and you have a clear thesis statement.** You support your thesis with relevant examples and evidence, and you write in a clear and concise style. However, there are a few areas where you could improve:
            
            - **Introduction:** Your introduction is a bit weak and could be more concise. You could start by stating your thesis statement more directly, such as: "There are two main approaches to university education: focusing on one's major or widening one's horizons by exploring other fields. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will vary depending on the individual student's goals."
            - **Body paragraphs:** Your body paragraphs are well-organized and informative. However, you could make them even stronger by using more specific language and evidence. For example, instead of saying "Students who try different fields and get them involved in topics outside their studies like student activities tend to have this mindset," you could say "Students who participate in extracurricular activities outside of their major, such as student government or clubs, are more likely to have a continuous growth mindset." You could also provide more examples of the benefits of each approach. For example, you could mention how students who focus on their major may be more likely to get into a good graduate program or land a high-paying job, while students who widen their horizons may be more adaptable to change and better able to solve complex problems.
            - **Conclusion:** Your conclusion is a bit weak and could be more forceful. You could restate your thesis statement and summarize your main points. You could also end with a strong statement about the importance of choosing the right approach for each individual student.

            The projected plan below describes the changing in a public library during a period of twenty years from now. This essay will describe the development that has occurred.
            
            First of all, let us begin with the big elephant in the room: all the tables and chairs were removed from the Central Library leaving more empty room in the library. On the other hand, different places either got modernized or totally replaced. The CafÃ© one can see in modern plan on right down corner was an Enquiry disk which was helping in a lot of tasks and not to mention the change in the structure of the room which got modernized. In the right top corner one can see that 20 years ago it was a room for Childrenâ€™s books, but it has been replaced with Lecture room now and the childrenâ€™s books have replaced the CDs, videos, computer games room which was on the left top corner and some features were added to it like Sofas and a location for Storytelling events. The Reading room in the left bottom corner has been reconstructed to be a computer room. The change was not only in rooms it also reached the paths between them. If one looked next to the location where the Tables and chairs where he can see that to the right of them there were an Adult-non-fiction books and now itâ€™s for Adult fiction books and Self-service machines. Also, to the left one can see that there have been an All-reference books which replaced the Adult-fiction books.
            
            In conclusion, there have been a full reconstruction of the Central Library with different landmarks being either removed, replaced, or reconstructed to form the new Central Library one can see today.

            The movement of the individuals from countryside and farms to the more civilized cities caused a visible decrease in the head count that can work in farms. In this essay we will discuss how this transformation can lead to a decrease in GDA if not considered properly.
            
            First of all, the most important part of any economy is not the money as many may predict. It was and always will be the individual who was responsible on making the outcome of the country which we measure with GDA. In my point of view, country outcome comes from two main sectors: Industrial sector and Agriculture sector. The industrial sector includes any product that a country produce, the Agriculture sector is responsible on making the raw material for example crops, yarns, animal products, etc. The continuous departure of the farmers from there farms to live in big cities leads to a tremendous decrease in the outcome from agriculture. This decrease will not only be seen in agriculture but also in Industrial sector as there will be a need for raw ingredients which will eventually decrease the output of the country. One can describe this outcome as negative on country, but there is also some hidden negative outcome on the farmers themselves. First, there farm will be abandoned and will not be suitable for agriculture. Second is the government, the smaller number of people living in a certain area the less money the government will allocate to their healthcare, education, and so on which will lead to more people leave which will cause a bigger problem.
            
            In conclusion, this noticed pattern of continuous movement of rural people can lead to a severe outcome on the economy. In my view, this outcome will include a decrease in the overall outcome of the country, decrease in the yielded crops, and on a certain level it may stop the government from allocating enough resources for the healthcare and education in the countryside. Overall, this change needs to be monetarized regularly to avoid any consequences.

            This chart shows the variation in the prices of three metals: Nickel, Copper and Zinc. The prices are averaged and reported monthly throughout the year 2014. In this essay, we will discuss the pattern of change the three metals go through during the reported year.
            In the year 2014, there have been a continuous fluctuation in the prices of the reported metals, but one can see there is a pattern that all the metals followed, which can be summarized in a decrease in the prices until the first half of the year, then a fluctuation in prices in the second half with an overall increase.
            
            In the first half, Nickel, Copper, and Zinc began the year at the values of 6%,2%, and 1% respectively, but by the middle of the year all their prices were at loss. The biggest decrease was in Nickelâ€™s price which settled at -3% from the previous month value.
            
            In the second half, the prices of the three metals started to grow again with a period with a fixed pattern between July and September. The values settled at the end of the year with both Copper and Zinc at slightly below of their original value at the beginning of the year and Zinc at loss from 6% to 1% at the end of the year.
            
            In conclusion, the prices of the three metals went through a big change throughout the year which resulted in a change of their order based on the price from Nickel, Copper, Zinc to Zinc, Copper, Nickel. The change followed an overall similar pattern where all the prices decreased in the first half and increased again in the second half.

            In this era, one can see that there has been a decline in the death due to wars, epidemics, and low healthcare. This decrease paved the path to increase the life span of the population, which sometimes can be a load on the government. In this essay we will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of having older people with us.
            
            First of all, the older the man gets the wiser he would be. The wisdom of older people keeps guiding us on daily basis. How many times people need an advice and found it from the mouth of their father on any fatherly figure!! Their advice can show us the light at the end of the tunnel. However, the wisdom is not the only thing one can get. The sense of security grows a lot, especially if one can see that on his old days, he will not be left alone which in return can push him to work harder and to spend more which will run the wheel of economy and increase GDA.
            
            On the other hand, the existence of the elders with no doubt is a load on the government. The paychecks that are being given to them month by month without an actual output can reduce GDA which measures the overall productivity of the country. The load is not only on the government but also on the individuals. The older you get the more vulnerable you are to diseases which will be a load on your family, especially if they have some money disadvantages. I can relate to that; my grandmother is currently having some heath issues which caused a big burden on the whole family.
            
            In conclusion, elder people can weigh down the economy by reducing the overall productivity of the country, but if one looked to them from a more humanly prospective, one can see that they give us something to fight for, which a more philosophical person may call it hope. Also, there presence prove that the government prioritize us, which can increase our sense of security and our productivity.
