# Verb Tenses

Certainly! Let's explore verb tenses in depth, organized into numbered headings.

# 1. **Introduction to Verb Tenses**

Verbs play a crucial role in indicating the time of an action, event, or state of being in a sentence. Verb tenses help us understand when an action occurred, whether it's happening now, happened in the past, or will happen in the future.

# 2. **Present Tense**

## 2.1 Simple Present Tense

The simple present tense is used for actions or states that are habitual, factual, or general truths. It often follows the basic subject-verb structure.

- Example: *She walks to the park every morning.*

## 2.2 Present Continuous Tense

The present continuous tense describes actions happening at the moment or around the present time. It uses a form of "to be" (am, is, are) and the present participle (-ing form of the verb).

- Example: *They are playing tennis right now.*

## 2.3 Present Perfect Tense

The present perfect tense expresses actions that occurred at an unspecified time before now or have relevance to the present. It combines "have" or "has" with the past participle of the verb.

- Example: *I have seen that movie before.*

## 2.4 Present Perfect Continuous Tense

This tense indicates actions that started in the past and continue up to the present. It uses "have been" or "has been" along with the present participle.

- Example: *She has been working here for five years.*
